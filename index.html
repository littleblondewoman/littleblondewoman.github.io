          I am "that person" who always cooks an obscene amount of food for dinner parties. The person who daily gives their money to a crazy homeless lady, despite knowing they will spend the cash on cigarettes directly after. I will always go the distance to help a fellow human being. I like making people happy. It gives me a high.

      <p>
           I started in a tiny Mobil Petrol station when I was twelve years old, charming the truckies and wiping their tables down. I have managed restaurants, kitchens, service teams and successfully dealt with every kind of customer you could ever conceive. I have been in service industry for the last thirteen years and I have no plans of stopping.
      </p>

      <p>
          I used to be a chef and have spent the last ten years hopping between the kitchen and managing front-of-house teams. I pretended that I liked the kitchen but really, I loved wooing my regulars, making people feel comfortable and helping them with their problems. In my last job as Head Chef at Campaign Monitor, I built a hospitality department and created an amazing culture. It was an amazing opportunity, but I craved a more customer-facing and technical role. Under the guidance of Campaign Monitor’s support-lead, Matthew Patterson, I learnt about the tools I would need to take on a customer support role, such as language skills, communication and using the support tool Desk.

      <p>
          My first customer support job was at Red Pen. I found that managing service teams in a hospitality environment has given me incredible patience under pressure. People have also told me I have a super-human amount of empathy and unwavering friendliness. I am teaching myself HTML, CSS and I’m on the way to learning Python (gosh, isn’t it challenging!). I’ve found my calling and I learn anything to get better at what I do.

         I'm looking for the best thing in customer support. Let's work together to make people happier.
