      <h2>Customer Support</h2>

            <p>
                  I am "that person" who always cooks an obscene amount of food for dinner parties. The person who gives their money to a crazy homeless lady, despite knowing they will spend the cash on cigarettes directly after.  I will always go the distance to help a fellow human being. I like making people happy. It gives me a high. 

            </p>   

            <p>
                 I started in a tiny Mobil Petrol station when I was twelve years old, charming the truckies and wiping their tables down. Since then I have managed restaurants, kitchens, service teams and successfully dealt with every kind of customer you could imagine. I have been in the service industry for the last thirteen years and I have no plans of stopping.
            </p>

            <p>
                People are complex, confusing, multi-layered beings. I have learnt through serving and assisting customers through the large portion of my life that you cannot treat everyone’s problems the same. There is no default response that you can regurgitate to every person who needs help. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Listening is the most important thing I have learnt. A lot of people confuse “service” or “support” with being a person who knows an awful lot of information about a given topic or service. I’m not saying its untrue. I’m saying that it's about listening and taking that information to formulate a response: not the answer that you have- but the answer that they need.
            </p>

             <p>
               I'm looking for the best thing in technical support. Let's work together to make people happier.
