				Here are my answers to your questions
			</h3>

			<h2 class="signal-questions">
				Why do you want to work in customer support?
				
			</h2>

			<p>
				Customer support is my thing and I’m good at it. I have learnt that there are a lot of great people in this world and an equal amount of people who are irate and misunderstood. I have worked in customer service for a long time, and I know how to communicate,  empathize and problem-solve with a variety of different people. I don’t know how it happens, but I seem to make friends with everyone.
			</p>

			<p> 
				I want to work in customer support because I understand and appreciate the power in the role, what it means, and how important the connection is between the business and its customers. In an email I have the capacity to ruin a business's reputation for a user or create a customer for life with an amazing experience. This is special.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also believe there is a difference between making customers happy and making customers happy, productively. Being nice is fine, but the real work is in finding solutions and addressing issues. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m working on it, but I’m not a nerd (yet). I’m a tirelessly people-pleasing person who is curious and wants to help. And so, I want to join 37signals because I want to build on my current skills, learn more, and work for a company who will value my experience.

			Why do you want to work at 37signals?

				
			</h2>


			

				<p>
				I want to work for 37signals because I appreciate how your products are tailored toward the customer. There is no training required and your customers don’t have to be the most technical people in the world to get involved, understand and benefit from your products.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The number one reason I want to work for you is that you care about your customer support. I want to be part of a company where customer support is a top priority and be part of a team which tries new things all the time to get better results. 
				</p>

				<p>
				For example, on the 4th December, I was watching a Twitter thread where 37signals were experiencing issues with Basecamp, Highrise and Campfire. This is my favorite tweet : “@JYarchoan John, it's killing us too. We work so very hard to be 100% reliable, so when something like this hits, it's really painful. Sorry.” This is powerful. You communicated with your customers with so much sincerity and honesty which speaks volumes about your customer support values. You weren’t attempting to lie about anything, because that’s not what customer support is. That impressed me.

				A description of a great customer service/support experience you had recently, and what made it great.
				
				
				
				</h2>


				<p>
				My friends birthday was coming up and I was looking for some Breaking Bad memorabilia for him. I found an artist online called Cat Lines, a graphic designer in the UK, who makes fan-art posters of the main characters. I knew my designer friends wouId love it. I bought one straight away and only a few minutes after I had sent it through my payment, I received an email back from the artist herself expressing her excitement and glee. It was the first poster she had sold- and from Australia of all places! It was evident that she was appreciative, cared about her artwork and wanted my friend to have an awesome experience. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Her happiness was infectious and she liked me so much that she offered to write a handwritten note to my friend for his birthday. The gift arrived, wrapped and with her hand-written note (which was about two pages long) about her art and who she was.
				This was a genuine interaction, an unexpected one. It was a microscopic interaction for her, but a big deal to me.  Cat Lines nailed it.

			<h2 class="signal-questions">
			I'm interested in your products, but not sure which one is right for me. What's the difference between Highrise and Basecamp?
			

			</h2>

			<p>
			Hi Tim, 
			</p>

			<p>
			Thanks for getting in touch. To break it down simply- Basecamp is team oriented and Highrise is person oriented. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Basecamp is great if you have a project, or a few to manage. Basecamp helps keep you organised- it tracks your to-do lists and also the tasks assigned to the team members. Your team members are also involved in the project account, which is great because they can comment and everyone knows what's going on. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Highrise is about the people, Basecamp is about your projects. In Highrise, you can import all the contacts you’ve acquired, business cards and email conversations you’ve had with people. It organises your files, contacts, birthdays and even keeps track of the last time you chatted to someone. Highrise will help keep you organized about the clients you have in your business and it gives your contacts a frame of reference. Highrise would be really beneficial for you if you travel a lot for your work, if your colleagues work remote or if you contact a lot clients on a regular basis and need to keep track.
				</p>

			<p>
			Both of the tools are super valuable and they both have different benefits. Before committing you can experience the apps for yourself using the free demos. When you decide which one works for you its easy to upgrade. If you change your mind in the future you are free to cancel at any time. 
			</p>

			<p>
			I hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any further questions.  
			</p>

				Is the new Basecamp offered in any other language besides English?
				
			</h2>

			
				
				<p>
				Hi Tim,
				</p>
				<p>
				Thanks for reaching out and for using Basecamp. We’re happy to have you on board! :)
				</p>
				<p>
				At the moment the new Basecamp is offered in English only. However, Basecamp does allow UTF-8 character sets which allows you to enter your text in many languages including Chinese, Japanese, French, German and English. Translation of the interface is something we may do at a future date, but it’s not really on the cards right now for the new Basecamp. 
				</p>

				<p>
				The great news it that Basecamp classic still supports this! It’s offered in a over a dozen different languages. If you want to check it out you can sign up for a trial version here: http://basecamp.com/classic
				</p>

				<p>
				If you have any queries, please don’t hesitate to shoot me another email. I’d be happy to help. 
				Thanks!
				</p>

				<h2 class="signal-questions">
				I've been a Basecamp Classic user for years and see you have a new version. What's the difference between the versions, and why should I switch?
				
				
				</h2>

				<p>
				Hey Tim, 
				</p>

				<p>
				The new Basecamp has some pretty awesome new features and updates happening. It still have the core things you’re used to with some great improvements. 
				</p>

				<p>
				These are a few of the improvements in the new version: 
				</p>

				<p>
				We have integrated with Google Docs, so that now you can easily attach new documents to emails or files. Because you don’t always have the files handy, we've macde it so you can connect them to Basecamp. We’ve made sharing easier. 
				</p>
				<p>
-				 The single-paged project view will make your 					project run easier, with an entire overview on 					one page. Nothing will ever 	
				get lost. Everyone can see what’s happening, and it makes for improved communication 					within your team. Files, attachments, discussions, comments and text documents are all in the one place 				for simple organization. 
				</p>

				<p>
- 				We now offer storage upgrades for larger and smaller 	packages, in whatever plan you choose. This great 					storage add-on feature means that changing your data plan now only takes a few seconds. 
				</p>

				<p>
-  				The new Progress view allows you to keep track 	of your project the instant developments happen. It 						includes a catch-up page which informs you of all progress from the day prior. You also have a daily 					progress timeline, which is a daily record which updates on everything which is happening on your project.  				This feature also keeps track of when things are added, changed, deleted and by whom. It keeps you team 				accountable. 
				</p>

				<p>
				To check out what else we have that’s new at Basecamp Next,  check out https://basecamp.com/announcements for more info. Basecamp Classic isn’t going anywhere, but if you’re interested you can test it using your current projects on the 60-day free trial we’re offering. There's some info on how to easily move your projects here https://basecamp.com/transition-steps If you change your mind and want to revert back to the Basecamp Classic, you can rest assure all your information and data will be exactly the way you left it. However, your two accounts aren’t linked, and If you want to revert back to Basecamp Classic, keep in mind your new changes will not be saved in your original account. 
				</p>

				<p>
				You can upgrade your Basecamp account at little or no extra cost, depending on your account. I would try it out, push some things around and enjoy all the great features we’ve made. Happy testing!
				</p>

				<p>
				Let me know If there is anything else I can help you with,
